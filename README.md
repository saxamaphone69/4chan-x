# 4chan XT

4chan XT is a script that adds various features to anonymous imageboards. It was originally developed for 4chan but has
no affiliation with it.

4chan XT was originally forked from [4chan X](https://github.com/ccd0/4chan-x) for
[this PR](https://github.com/ccd0/4chan-x/pull/3341), It is a migration of 4chan X from coffeescript to
TypeScript/JavaScript. It is named XT both as a continuation of eXTended, and a T for TypeScript. The goals of this
project is to first get a working bundle from js/ts files, and then gradually convert js files to ts and add types as
needed.

New features since the fork include:

- Fetching the thread from an external archive and inserting deleted posts
- Basic audio posts support
- Automatically converting unsupported image files to png
- Automatically JPG'ing image files above the size limit
- Having both relative time and a timestamp on a post at the same time
- Counting poster ID's as a replacement of the deleted IP counter
- Hiding all posts from a poster ID in a thread
- A manifest v3 version for chromium browsers dropping support for v2
- A button to un-randomize a filename in the quick reply
- Showing the reason a post was filtered in the stub

4chan X was previously developed by [ccd0](https://github.com/ccd0/4chan-x),
[aeosynth](https://github.com/aeosynth/4chan-x), [Mayhem](https://github.com/MayhemYDG/4chan-x),
[ihavenoface](https://github.com/ihavenoface/4chan-x), [Zixaphir](https://github.com/zixaphir/appchan-x),
[Seaweed](https://github.com/seaweedchan/4chan-x), and [Spittie](https://github.com/Spittie/4chan-x), with contributions
from many others.

## Please note
**Uninstalling**: 4chan XT disables the native extension, so if you uninstall 4chan XT, you'll need to re-enable it.
To do this, click the `[Settings]` link in the top right corner, uncheck "`Disable the native extension`" in the panel
that appears, and click the "`Save Settings`" button. If you don't see a "`Save Settings`" button, it may be being
hidden by your ad blocker.

**Private browsing**: By default, 4chan XT remembers your last read post in a thread and which posts were made by you,
even if you are in private browsing / incognito mode. If you want to turn this off, uncheck the
`Remember Last Read Post` and `Remember Your Posts` options in the settings panel. You can clear all 4chan browsing
history saved by 4chan XT by resetting your settings. This fork also includes an option to export settings without
exporting your history.

Use of the "Link Title" feature to fetch titles of Youtube links is subject to Youtube's
[Terms of Service](https://www.youtube.com/t/terms) and [Privacy Policy](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy).
For more details on what information is sent to Youtube and other sites, and how to turn it off if you don't want the
feature, see upstream 4chan X's [privacy documentation](https://github.com/ccd0/4chan-x/wiki/Privacy).

## Install

This fork is distributed through [GitHub releases](https://github.com/TuxedoTako/4chan-xt/releases) and [Greasy Fork](https://greasyfork.org/scripts/489508-4chan-xt).
There are known issues with updating user scripts through GitHub: [#34](https://github.com/TuxedoTako/4chan-xt/issues/34)
[violentmonkey#1673](https://github.com/violentmonkey/violentmonkey/issues/1673), but Greasy Fork doesn't allow the
minified version. Automatic updates are supported for the user script version, but not the Chrome extension.

## Build from source

The simplest build is as easy as `npm install` `npm run build`, but there are some options:

- `-min`: Minified output.
- `-platform=userscript`, `-platform=crx`: Only builds for one platform, and removes code related to only the other.
  Note that without this, the code is only build once without this optimization for both.
- `-no-format` Skips some formatting like switching the indent from the TypeScript output back from 4 to 2, and removing
  the decaffeinate suggestions comments. Might speed up the build, but the result is larger.
- `-test` Include tests in build.

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter a bug, try the steps [here](https://github.com/TuxedoTako/4chan-xt/blob/project-XT/CONTRIBUTING.md#reporting-bugs),
then report it to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/TuxedoTako/4chan-xt/issues?q=is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc).
If the bug seems to be caused by a script update, you can install a old version from the
[GitHub releases](https://github.com/TuxedoTako/4chan-xt/releases) or from
[Greasy Fork](https://greasyfork.org/scripts/489508-4chan-xt/versions).

- find alternative for `<% if (`
  - [x] made html templates jsx/txt functions
    - this uses the typescript compiler to compile the jsx
    - render code is in [src/globals/jsx.ts](./src/globals/jsx.ts)
  - [x] binary files are included as base64 in the bundle step, they do need explicit imports
  - [x] `<% if (readJSON('/.tests_enabled')) { %>`
    - replaced by `// #region tests_enabled` `// #endregion`
- build script
  - [x] userscript
  - [ ] .crx extension
    - [x] crx directory that can be loaded as an unpacked extension is created
- [x] port updates made to 4chan-X made since this was forked
- [ ] Clean up circular dependencies

### Other notes about this fork

<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

- A lot of files have circular dependencies, but rollup can handle that
  - but for some scripts that add to the same object I had to merge them, like Posting/QR and site/SW.yotsuba.js
  - sometimes something might not be initialized before use, for example, `$.dict()` and `$.SECONDS`
    - I moved these to a new file called helpers.ts, which shouldn't have dependencies itself
- tsconfig.json has `"checkJs": true,`, and a lot of js files report type errors when opened because of unknown
  properties on objects and reassigning variables with different types. These errors don't block the bundle at this moment.
- the es 2020 target was chosen for optional chaining
- @violentmonkey/types was chosen over @types/greasemonkey because @types/greasemonkey only declares the GM object,
  and not GM\_ functions
