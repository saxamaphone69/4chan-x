## 4chan XT changelog

4chan XT uses a different user script namespace than 4chan X, so to migrate you need to export settings from 4chan X,
and import them in XT.

### 2.19.0 (2024-12-22)

- Removed the css for the header for widths above 1300px, because it was preventing long custom navigation lists from
  wrapping. [#120](https://github.com/TuxedoTako/4chan-xt/issues/120) I don't know what the purpose was of the different
  style, the commit where that was added isn't really descriptive: c396db49b9d8fe1becad2fd9c8b29e88ead7b587? So let me
  know if I broke something.
- Limit subject input to 100 characters. [#128](https://github.com/TuxedoTako/4chan-xt/issues/128)
- Added ws and nsw classes for work safe and not work safe boards.
  [#129](https://github.com/TuxedoTako/4chan-xt/issues/129)
- Using shift click to hide a post no longer selects half the page.
  [#131](https://github.com/TuxedoTako/4chan-xt/issues/131)
- The file select dialog for the settings import will only show json files.
- Upstream came back, so I had to port those new features.
  - Fix for unwanted sorting of catalog under certain settings. [ccd0#3212](https://github.com/ccd0/4chan-x/issues/3212),
    7dfba22042d01fde1e762af68e92109d80d0164d
  - Turn JS Whitelist functionality off by default. 419e90c38eddc65a5a32e4a17a8211b3157ae61e
    - Better way of turning off JS Whitelist. 7df2750fadffe0b5cc441b21034563c95c8500bd

- The quick reply now supports mp4. [#124](https://github.com/TuxedoTako/4chan-xt/pull/124)

  - A warning will be shown is an image was changed automatically.

- Fixed quoted OPs not showing reply and image count. [#71](https://github.com/TuxedoTako/4chan-xt/issues/71) Might be a
  new feature, since it seems it was never supported, but I'm counting it as a bug fix because native 4chan has it.

- Address wobbly spin animation. [#65](https://github.com/TuxedoTako/4chan-xt/pull/65)

- Button to watch threads now uses an svg icon instead of a background image, and is now a button instead of an anchor.
  This should only be important if you use custom css to style it.

- PostHiding now waits for the board config, so the option to hide by poster ID should always appear on boards with
  those. [#41 (comment)](https://github.com/TuxedoTako/4chan-xt/issues/41#issuecomment-2087805190)
- Restoring deleted posts from archives when reply threading is active no longer recalculates the threads. Turning reply
  threading off and on again still works. [#55](https://github.com/TuxedoTako/4chan-xt/issues/55)

### 2.8.1 (2024-04-23)

- Fixed quick reply modal putting icon buttons in the wrong place in the catalog.
  [#54](https://github.com/TuxedoTako/4chan-xt/issues/54)
- Removed 'Work around CORB Bug', which was fixed in chrome 85, while this script is 90 and up.
  - Because this meant a file had a dependency less, which in combination with the circular dependencies, caused some
    files to be in a different order in the output, and caused some common variables to not have `$1` appended. So sorry
    for the giant diff.
- Code specific for the userscript isn't in the chrome extension anymore and vice versa.

  failing silently. [#53](https://github.com/TuxedoTako/4chan-xt/issues/53)

- Time formatting now falls back to browser locale instead of giving an error when the locale is not set.
- Update notification link now links to the changelog on the right branch on github.

### XT v2.1.0 (2023-06-24)

- Limited support for audio posts: they work in threads but not yet in the gallery. Might add if there's demand.
  - Can be disabled in the settings
- Small performance improvements
  - Removed unnecessary `Array.from`s from coffeescript to js migration
  - Time module: cache Intl.DateTimeFormat objects
  - callbackNodesDB: increase nr of callbacks because the setTimeout triggers a reflow, which in some of my tests took
    as long as the actual chunk of callbacks

### XT v2.0.0 (2023-04-30)

This is the first XT release, which means this is after the migration from coffeescript to typescript, but there are
some other changes as well. These changes aren't in the upstream PR.

- Optimized image filters: filters are in a Map with the hash as key, instead of iterating over all image filters
- I removed font awesome to make the script smaller, and used unicode icons instead. This might break some user scripts
  build in 4chan X that rely on them, and I only tested on windows.
- For even smaller user script size, there is a minified version available
- https://github.com/ccd0/4chan-x/pull/3352, fix for https://github.com/ccd0/4chan-x/issues/3349 was ported
